# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a young French man of 19 years old who loves everything that touches the computer.
This passion was born the day I discovered the Internet.
Since then, I have learned to create images *(and modify them)*, videos, 3D models or even create programs !

# ðŸ”­ What I am working on:
Currently, I am a student in [BTS Computer Services for Organizations option Software Solutions and Business Applications](https://www.onisep.fr/Ressources/Univers-Formation/Formations/Post-bac/bts-services-informatiques-aux-organisations-option-b-solutions-logicielles-et-applications-metiers)<br/>
However, I am currently working on other projects:
* [Zanoria](https://github.com/ZanoriaTeam) - a Minecraft Bedrock Edition server using an open source server software written in PHP called [PocketMine](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP)
* [Royaume](https://github.com/Virtual-Royaume) - a French community of developers, we work together on different projects to expand our knowledge and skills
